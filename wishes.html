It deeply agonized me. Marakka maten da🤣.He used to be the czar of hacking in my class even seniors used to approach him. From hacking  GTA : VICE city to dragon city,he used to do all crazy things to win a game.Computer mam favourite. Happie b'day da playboy♥️🥳🎊🎉. </p>

          <p class="card-text">Hey Akkkshaaayyy!!
I guess the first time we talked was during ML classes and I thought you were silent and reserved. I never thought that we would ever become friends! CCCL wouldn’t have been the same if you weren’t there! From fighting for places in the last row to Belgian waffles and ENPT..you became more fun to be around with!! Those metro rides with you and Keerthi made that boring routine a bit more enjoyable..!! You know you don’t get to meet many people with similar taste in series and movies!!! Anyways, thank you for making the boring internship a bit more interesting and memorable!! Wish you abundance of happiness and continue to spread your positivity and excess knowledge to everyone around with your cartoon-ish face!
Many more happy returns of the day and a happyyyyy happy birthdayyyyyy! <3 </p>

You are completely different person from what I have thought or imagined about you (everything in good way). I may be wrong but still I feel you are the one person who speak your heart and do whatever your heart tells. I wish you an amazing future ❤️ stay happy always🤗</p>

Happy birthday akshay!!!You are one of the most smartest and the sweetest Person I know. Every moment with you is funn. You make me laugh so hard and you spread so much joy. Love pulling your leg 😂😂 and in that process you will end up pulling my leg too 😅😅😂. I really don't remember how we even started talking but i am go glad I have you as one of my closest friends. I can't choose a single memory with you it's very hard as we have so many. The really fun CCCL days. There wasn't one day we haven't laughed. And me calling you akshayyyyy in class and coming to you with gossips 😜😜. The projects and events we have done together and the things i have learnt from you will always be in my memory for a long time. The carpooling scenes with dilip, the metro rides,  standing outside labs and staffrooms all these memories and moments with you are unforgettable. I will cherish them for life. I really hope our friendship continuous for a long time. Thank you for all the help you have done for me.Finally Super sexy raho sexy 😂😂❤️❤️ SSRS
Can't wait to sing it again and see your awkward smile for that 😂😂😅😅</p>
